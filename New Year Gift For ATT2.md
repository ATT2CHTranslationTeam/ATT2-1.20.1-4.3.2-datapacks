【The following English text was translated by AI】
The two errors in the original loot table have been fixed. Additionally, the enigmatic set sold by the wulken blacksmith has been changed from epi/leather to epi_set/leather, and it can now be triggered normally.
Everything else remains unchanged.
This data pack does not support downgrading from version 1.20.2 to 1.20.1 for players who have already played; doing so will cause many issues, and the invisibility of all NPC villagers will be disabled.
Using the official map to switch the data pack and then entering the map should trigger everything normally.
